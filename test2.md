Background
==========

Suppose you get the following question: “Mom (or Dad) ... Which coding exon has the highest number of single nucleotide polymorphisms on chromosome 22?”. You think to yourself “Wow! This is a simple question ... I know exactly where the data is (at UCSC) but how do I actually compute this?” The truth is, there is really no straightforward way of answering this question in a time frame comparable to the attention span of a 7-year-old. Well ... actually there is and it is called Galaxy. So let's try it...

Setup
=====

Create an account or Log in to orione.crs4.it
---------------------------------------------

Connect to <http://orione.crs4.it>, go to the User link at the top of Galaxy interface and choose:

`* `**`Login`**`, if you have an account. Enter your credentials and you're in!`
`* `**`Register`**`, if you don't have yet an account. Put on the `“`create` `users`”` form your email, a password and a public name and then log in.`

How to change password
----------------------

From the “User” menu at the top, choose “Preferences” and then “Manage your information” to access the change password form

Getting coding exons from UCSC
------------------------------

First thing we will do is to obtain data from UCSC by clicking “Get Data -&gt; \_\_UCSC Main\_\_ table browser”. You will see Galaxy's middle pane change to looks like this:
